# LaserDynamicsSimulator
This repository contains the MATLAB simulation code for a four-level Thulium-doped Yttrium Lithium Fluoride (Tm:YLF) laser kinetics model. The primary goal is to adjust model parameters and simulation works with a set of first-order differential equations representing the rate dynamics of the laser system.
